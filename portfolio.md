Cart to Kitchen is an all-in-one app that allows users to discover and search for recipes, save recipes to favorites, add ingredients from specific recipes to a grocery list, and search for nearby grocery stores with Google maps integrated functionality.

This project was made for the UCSD Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp using the Spoonacular API, Google Maps/Places API, javascript/jquery/lodash.js, bootstrap, and firebase live databases.

## Train Scheduler

This Journey themed train scheduling app is my fifth project for the UCSD Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my understanding of Firebase and MomentJS.

In this app, the user plays the role of a train administrator that is in charge of creating train schedules. By submitting the train name, destination, time the first train runs, and the train's frequency, the app then is able to calculate when the next train is due to arrive, and how many minutes away said train is.

The database that stores all of the train information is in firebase, and thus the data persists across different browsing sessions, and multiple people are able to update the train schedule at the same time.

This GIFtastic gif fetcher is my fourth project working with javascript/jquery for the UCSD Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my understanding of AJAX, APIs, and just for fun, bootstrap modals as well.

GIFtastic allows the user to find reaction gifs based either on pre-existing buttons that match a certain emotion (happy, sad, etc.) or to dynamically generate buttons of their own. Clicking on a button will generate an API call to the Giphy API and return with 10 gifs that correspond to the button clicked.

This "Crystal Collector" game is my second project working with javascript/jquery for the UCSD Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my understanding of variables, arrays, functions, onclick/onkey events, usage of the math.random function, and manipulating the DOM. I also used what I learned in our html and css sections to create a game that is aesthetically pleasing visually and is responsive.

The objective of Crystal Collector is to match your score with the crystal score by adding crystals to your collection. You can collect crystals by clicking on one of the four crystal images. Each crystal has a value that is predetermined before each round. If your score goes over the crystal score, you lose; otherwise if you match your score with the crystal score, you win!
