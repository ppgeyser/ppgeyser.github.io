Plant Parenthood is an app centered around new plant parents looking to adopt a plant into their life, or expert plant parents looking for a way to keep track of their needs. Features include plant discovery, watering schedule, social media image feed, and manual plant entry.

This project was built with the help of Devin Steweart, Zuzana Volny, and Jannah Nieves. It is a full stack MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) App that also utilizes firebase cloud storage and auth0 user authentication.

I was responsible for setting up the backend of this app and building out some React components. Specific tasks included: 

- Building reusable React components such as as information display cards, buttons, and image cards.
- Setting up MongoDB using Mongoose to build the schema and controller
- Constructing API routes for all CRUD operations using Express
- Creating frontend API calls using Axios
- Ensuring that all React components were able to properly successfully make API calls in order to execute CRUD operations
- Contributing to the functionality of the social media image feed, which allows users to upload their own images and to see other users' images.
- Configuring environmental variables for development and production environments for auth0
- Deploying application to Heroku

Cart to Kitchen is an all-in-one app that allows users to discover and search for recipes, save recipes to favorites, add ingredients from specific recipes to a grocery list, and search for nearby grocery stores with Google maps integrated functionality.

This front end project was built with the help of Devin Steweart, Zuzana Volny, and Divya Enjamuri using the Spoonacular API, Google Maps/Places API, javascript/jquery/lodash.js, bootstrap, and firebase live databases.

## Google Books React Search

<img width="720" alt="Google Books React Search Screenshot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50184318/68524819-0ae3eb80-0280-11ea-9420-00e113c6ed04.png">

<a href="https://github.com/ppgeyser/google-book-react">Github</a>
<br>
<a href="https://react-gbooks-search.herokuapp.com/">Demo</a>

This Google Books React Search app has two different sections. The search section allows a user to search for books listed in Google Books via the Google Books API. The results are then populated. Each result includes the book title, author's name, description, book cover, and link to see the book in Google Books. Users also have an option to save books they are interested in. The saved section allows users to look through the books they have saved. They are also able to delete any books they would no longer like to save.

This is my first full MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) app. This project showcases my understanding of more intermediate React concepts such as React routing, in order to create an SPA (single page application). This app also follows industry best-practices, such as separating my front-end files into a client folder and keeping the rest of the backend node.js and express.js files in the root of my application directory.

This Formula 1 clicky game is all about memory! To get started, all you have to do is click on a driver image to earn points. However, don't click on any driver more than once, or you lose your points and have to start over!

This is my first frontend react app. This project showcases my understanding of the basic tenets of React, such as components, state, and props. This app also follows industry best-practices, such as separating components into stateless and stateful components. This is also my first app using ES6 and JSX in order to facilitate developing in React.

## Pitchfork Scraper

<a href="https://github.com/ppgeyser/pitchfork-scraper">Github</a>
<br>
<a href="https://p4k-scraper.herokuapp.com/">Demo</a>

This web scraper grabs album reviews from pitchfork.com, the music review website. Each scraped review includes the album art, artist, and album name. Users are able to press the "Scrape" button to fetch new articles. Users are also able to add comments to each review, see other comments left by other users, and delete comments.

This is my third full stack web app. This project showcases my understanding of front and back end integration through the use of tools such as Node.js, Express.js, Express-Handlebars, as well as all of the regular front end tools such as Bootstrap, Javascript, and Jquery. I built upon my foundation of knowledge from my last project, but used a MongoDB database while also following the MVC code design paradigm.
