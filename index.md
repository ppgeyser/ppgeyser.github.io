My name is Peter and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with degrees in psychology and cinema studies. My educational background has helped me to create projects that are focused on being intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. 

I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the University of California San Diego, which covers technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Command Line, and Git.

I often work in groups utilizing industry-standard practices such as agile development, versioning control with Git, linting, progressive enhancement, and usage of continuous integration tools such as Travis CI. 

My soft skills include communication, teamwork, organization, multitasking, meeting deadlines and being a fast learner. Among my peers and coworkers, I am known for my humor, work ethic, and meticulousness.

In the future, I look forward to testing my skills and overcoming new challenges in a fast-paced and collaborative work environment that will strengthen my web development abilities.
