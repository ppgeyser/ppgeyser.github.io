My name is Peter and I am a Web Developer that comes from a background of working in IT and consumer electronics repair. Currently I work as a Software Engineer at Epik Systems in San Diego, CA. 

Completion of the University of California San Diego Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp has given me proficiency in MERN stack development, which includes technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Command Line, and Git.

I am a hard working and passionate team player with experience using industry standard practices such as agile development and versioning control using git.

Some of my soft skills include communication, teamwork, organization, multitasking, meeting deadlines and being a fast learner.

Throughout my time at my position at Epik Systems, I have gotten to learn and play with some really cool technologies and languages including Shopify, GraphQL/Apollo, Typescript, and Ruby on Rails. In the future, I look forward to expanding my skills and overcoming new challenges as I delve deeper into the world of web development.
