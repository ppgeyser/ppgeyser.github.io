Plant Parenthood is an app centered around new plant parents looking to adopt a plant into their life, or expert plant parents looking for a way to keep track of their needs. Features include plant discovery, watering schedule, social media image feed, and manual plant entry.

This project was built with the help of Devin Steweart, Zuzana Volny, and Jannah Nieves. It is a full stack MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) App that also utilizes firebase cloud storage and auth0 user authentication.

I was responsible for setting up the backend of this app and building out some React components. Specific tasks included: 

- Building reusable React components such as as information display cards, buttons, and image cards.
- Setting up MongoDB using Mongoose to build the schema and controller
- Constructing API routes for all CRUD operations using Express
- Creating frontend API calls using Axios
- Ensuring that all React components were able to properly successfully make API calls in order to execute CRUD operations
- Contributing to the functionality of the social media image feed, which allows users to upload their own images and to see other users' images.
- Configuring environmental variables for development and production environments for auth0
- Deploying application to Heroku

Cart to Kitchen is an all-in-one app that allows users to discover and search for recipes, save recipes to favorites, add ingredients from specific recipes to a grocery list, and search for nearby grocery stores with Google maps integrated functionality.

I built the entire favorites page, including all javascript functionality. I also contributed in the building of the landing page by programming the functionality of the results cards that populates randomly upon page load, or populates results based on the terms entered into the search field.

This front end project was built with the help of Devin Steweart, Zuzana Volny, and Divya Enjamuri using the Spoonacular API, Google Maps/Places API, javascript/jquery/lodash.js, bootstrap, and firebase live databases.

This Formula 1 clicky game is all about memory! To get started, all you have to do is click on a driver image to earn points. However, don't click on any driver more than once, or you lose your points and have to start over!

This is my first frontend react app. This project showcases my understanding of the basic tenets of React, such as components, state, and props. This app also follows industry best-practices, such as separating components into stateless and stateful components. This is also my first app using ES6 and JSX in order to facilitate developing in React.
