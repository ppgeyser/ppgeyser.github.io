My name is Peter and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer that comes from a background of working in IT and consumer electronics repairs.

Completion of the University of California San Diego Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp has given me skills in technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Command Line, and Git.

Through the Bootcamp, I often worked in groups utilizing industry-standard practices such as agile development, versioning control with Git, linting, progressive enhancement, and continuous integration tools such as Travis CI. 

My soft skills include communication, teamwork, organization, multitasking, meeting deadlines and being a fast learner. Among my peers and coworkers, I am known for my humor, work ethic, and meticulousness.

In the future, I look forward to testing my skills and overcoming new challenges in a fast-paced and collaborative work environment that will strengthen my web development abilities.
