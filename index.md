My name is Peter and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with degrees in psychology and cinema studies. My educational background has helped me to create projects that are focused on being intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. 

I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the University of California San Diego, which covers technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Command Line, and Git.

My soft skills include communication, teamwork, organization, multitasking, meeting deadlines and being a fast learner. Among my peers and coworkers, I am known for my humor, work ethic, and meticulousness.

Recently in a group of four, utilizing aspects of agile development, I worked to develop an app which used API calls and Firebase databases to help users to find and save their favorite recipes. Users are also able to add each recipeâ€™s ingredients to a shopping list and then find grocery stores nearby. 

In the future, I look forward to testing my skills and overcoming new challenges in a fast-paced and collaborative work environment that will strengthen my web development abilities.
