# Developer Portfolio: <a href="https://ppgeyser.github.io/">ppgeyser.github.io</a>

My developer portfolio was built using Hyde, which is a theme based on Jekyll created using Poole (a self-described butler for Jekyll). This was my first experience working with a CMS. It also involved configuring a Ruby installation, which we had not covered in class and required outside research in order to implement. Working with Jekyll also involved working with the documentation until I was comfortable enough to implement it for my portfolio. Here are the links to each of the individual projects for additional details:
