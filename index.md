My name is Peter and I am a UCSD Coding Bootcamp student. My background in technology started when I was very young. My dad was a programmer at Microsoft and at an early age I was exposed to computers and technology (mostly through the form of computer building, in order to play video games). After I graduated from the University of Washington with a double degree in Psychology (B.Sc.) and Cinema Studies (B.A.), I worked for three years at uBreakiFix Seattle. At uBreakiFix, I was a certified Asurion, Samsung, and Google technician. I did my fair share of hardware repairs on smartphones and tablets, but my primary specialty was computer repairs; both software and hardware.

After I moved to San Diego, I moved into more of an IT role. At the company I work at now, I am responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of our workstations, sleep diagnostic equipment, and servers. This Bootcamp has already taught me so much more than I ever knew about computers and technology. I hope to be able to apply this knowledge to transition from a support role to a developer role.

Thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio. You will see in my projects proficiency in all of the various tools required to be a full stack web developer. If you are interested in learning more, please feel free to reach out to me via my contact page!
