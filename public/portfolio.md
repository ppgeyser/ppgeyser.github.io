According to researchers, one of the causes of procrastination is that your brain values long-term benefits when they are in the future (tomorrow), but it values immediate gratification when it comes to the present moment (today). One of the ways to counteract this tendency is to make the consequences of procrastination more immediate.

PRO-Pal is a to-do list app that helps you to get a hold of your procrastination by adding consequences to your actions. Your PRO-pal starts with nine lives. Whenever you add a task to your to-do list, you are required to insert a time by which you expect to be done with your task. Complete this task later than your goal time, and your pal loses a life!

This incentivizes you to break tasks up into smaller, easier-to-accomplish subtasks so that it’s easier to not lose lives. This also makes consequences of procrastination more immediate (unless you’re cold-hearted and don’t care about cats, but then you’ve got other issues this app can’t help you with).

I built this app with the help of Dan Abana, Shane Cleland, and Divya Enjamuri. It is a full stack app which follows the Model View Controller Framework and uses MySQL/Sequelize, Express.js, Express-Handlebars, and Node.js. It also uses an external library called Tempus Dominus which is a Bootstrap stylized datepicker. This app showcases our combined knowledge of integrating front and back end technologies, concepts, and frameworks.

## Google Books React Search

<img width="720" alt="Google Books React Search Screenshot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50184318/68524819-0ae3eb80-0280-11ea-9420-00e113c6ed04.png">

<a href="https://github.com/ppgeyser/google-book-react">Github</a>
<br>
<a href="https://react-gbooks-search.herokuapp.com/">Demo</a>

This Google Books React Search app has two different sections. The search section allows a user to search for books listed in Google Books via the Google Books API. The results are then populated. Each result includes the book title, author's name, description, book cover, and link to see the book in Google Books. Users also have an option to save books they are interested in. The saved section allows users to look through the books they have saved. They are also able to delete any books they would no longer like to save.

This is my first full MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) app. This project showcases my understanding of more intermediate React concepts such as React routing, in order to create an SPA (single page application). This app also follows industry best-practices, such as separating my front-end files into a client folder and keeping the rest of the backend node.js and express.js files in the root of my application directory.

Users are able to press the "Scrape" button to fetch new articles. Users are also able to add comments to each review, see other comments left by other users, and delete comments.

This is my third full stack web app. This project showcases my understanding of front and back end integration through the use of tools such as Node.js, Express.js, Express-Handlebars, as well as all of the regular front end tools such as Bootstrap, Javascript, and Jquery. I built upon my foundation of knowledge from my last project, but used a MongoDB database while also following the MVC code design paradigm.

Eat-Da-Burger is a burger eating simulator that allows the user to select which burger to eat from a list of choices. Once they eat the burger, it is consumed and moved to a separate list for devoured burgers. They are unable to eat the burger for a second time once it has been eaten. However, users are able to add more burgers, ready for consumption, to the available list. 

This is my second full stack web app. This project showcases my understanding of front and back end integration through the use of tools such as Node.js, Express.js, Express-Handlebars, as well as all of the regular front end tools such as Bootstrap, Javascript, and Jquery. I built upon my foundation of knowledge from my last project, but also built my own ORM, and separated all of my code out so that it follows the MVC model.

## Train Scheduler
<img width="720" alt="Train Scheduler Screenshot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50184318/62813046-a0bf7d00-babd-11e9-911f-00f6b8e3eebb.png">

<br>
<a href="https://ppgeyser.github.io/train-schedule/">Demo</a>

In this app, the user plays the role of a train administrator that is in charge of creating train schedules. By submitting the train name, destination, time the first train runs, and the train's frequency, the app then is able to calculate when the next train is due to arrive, and how many minutes away said train is.

The database that stores all of the train information is in firebase, and thus the data persists across different browsing sessions, and multiple people are able to update the train schedule at the same time.

This Journey themed train scheduling app is my fifth project working with javascript/jquery with new added libraries. This project showcases my understanding of Firebase and MomentJS.
